            A patient claims that she forgot her bag in the room where she had a medical
            appointment on the last time she came to the hospital. The problem is that she had
            several appointments on that same day. She believes that the doctor’s name (first or
            last name, but not both) starts with “M” or “L” - she doesn’t have a good memory
            either. Find all the possible doctors that match the description.

            The hospital management team wants to get statistics on the appointments per
            doctors. For each doctor, the report should present the total and average number
            of appointments in each time slot of the week during the last year. For example,
            a report generated on 01/12/2019 should consider data since 01/12/2018.

            The hospital wants to retrieve information on the patients who had an appointment
            during the previous month. However, an information which is relevant for some managers
            is to find which patients visited the hospital every week, at least twice a week.
            Such patients probably should receive home visits from doctors.

            Managers want to project the expected monthly income if the hospital start to charge
            a small value from each patient. The value per appointment would depend on the age
            and the number of appointments per month. The rules are summarised in the table.
            Based on the rules above, what would be the income of the hospital in the previous month?

            The managers want to reward experienced and long serving doctors. For that, they want
            to find out the doctors who have attended at least five patients per year for the
            last 10 years. Also, such doctors should have had attended a total of at least 100
            patients in this period.
